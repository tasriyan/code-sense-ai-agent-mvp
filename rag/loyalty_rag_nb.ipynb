    "#### What we are testing here:\n",
    "- Basic Semantic Retrieval Testing: Query testing with loyalty-specific queries\n",
    "- Distance analysis for semantic similarity quality\n",
    "- Result ranking and relevance assessment\n",
    "- File and project coverage analysis\n",
    "- Filtered Retrieval Testing: semantic + filtering by project type, or file type, or project name\n",
    "- Edge cases: malformed queries, empty queries, very long queries, etc.\n",
    "    Examples:\n",
    "    - Basic queries (loyalty points microservice specific):\n",
    "        - \"loyalty points calculation rules\"\n",
    "        - \"order processing workflow\"\n",
    "        - \"customer data integration\"\n",
    "        - \"payment service integration\"\n",
    "        - \"business rule patterns\"\n",
    "    - Filtered Queries:\n",
    "        - C# files only\n",
    "        - Configuration files only\n",
    "        - Specific project filtering\n",
    "#### Reporting:\n",
    "- Human readable reports to use to compare embedding models and classifier performance\n",
    "For example, the reports can be used for this type of analysis:\n",
    "##### Updated Performance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "| Embedding Model | LLM | Avg Distance | Query Coverage | Best Query Distance |\n",
    "|----------------|-----|-------------|----------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** | **GPT-4.1** | **1.1287** | 54.55% | **0.6485** |\n",
    "| all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | CodeLlama | 1.1854 | **63.64%** | 0.7035 |\n",

    "| all-mpnet-base-v2 | CodeLlama | 1.2334 | 54.55% | 0.8506 |\n",
    "| all-mpnet-base-v2 | Claude 3.5 | 1.2502 | 51.52% | 0.9409 |\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Embedding Model Performance:**\n",
    "- **all-MiniLM-L6-v2 consistently outperforms all-mpnet-base-v2** across all LLM combinations\n",
    "- Average distance improvement: ~0.07-0.11 points better with MiniLM\n",
    "- This pattern holds regardless of which LLM generates the queries\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. LLM Query Generation Quality:**\n",
    "- **GPT-4.1 generates the highest quality queries** (lowest distances)\n",
    "- **CodeLlama has the best query coverage** but with slightly higher distances\n",
    "- **Claude 3.5 shows the most variation** and generally higher distances\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Best Combinations:**\n",
    "1. **all-MiniLM-L6-v2 + GPT-4.1** - Best overall performance\n",
    "2. **all-MiniLM-L6-v2 + CodeLlama** - Best coverage with good performance\n",
    "3. **all-mpnet-base-v2 + GPT-4.1** - Best MPNet combination\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The results consistently confirm that **all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is indeed performing better than all-mpnet-base-v2** for this specific loyalty points codebase. This is a genuine domain-specific finding that contradicts the general benchmark superiority of MPNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Winner: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 with GPT-4.1**\n",
    "- Lowest average retrieval distance (1.1287)\n",
    "- Best individual query performance (0.6485)\n",
    "- Most reliable semantic matching for this codebase"
